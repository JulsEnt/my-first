            </h2>
            <p>
                Know ye not, brethren, (for i speak to them that know the law,) how that the law
                has dominion over a man as long as he liveth? (2) For the woman which hat an husband is bound
                by the law to <i>her</i> husband be dead, so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed
                from the law of her husband.
